# Flavourcast

Our new contributor, Max Scott-Hayes, will be joining me to hear what the companies and start ups have to say.

# Flavour 

I am working to bring project Flavour to life. I work towards bringing high tech technologies to the bespoke market with onsite design and manufacture under one roof within central London. Technology allows us to bring clothing that is unique and one of one. This is a much more personal approach.

I am working to:
- Create state-of-the-art knitting machines
- Develop our custom sizing and design software using Swift frameworks and embed machine learning throughout.
- Source high-quality knit

If you can help with any of these please get in touch!

The website [Flavour Boutique](https://flavour.boutique) is currently being built through Swift on the Server frameworks and **unavailable**. I will update you when it is publicly available.
