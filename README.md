# Flavour
Flavour is a vertically integrated bespoke high-tech knitting company. That aims to make knit into every day clothing, smart formal or casual.

Flavour is crowdfunding to develop proprietary 3D design software and flat knitting machines. This will allow flavour to design and manufacture right on the same premise in the heart of London, UK. Therefore quality control is immediate and depending on the complexity of the garment an item can be not only designed but also manifactured within hours of the client walking through the door.
